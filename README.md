Square is an open source project written using the scratch programing language
## Using Scratch to play
To play, download Scratch [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/). Then run the sb2 file. Or, if you want, go to [the Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu), make a new project, click file>open, open the sb2 file, and you're good to go!
## Open the SWF file to play
Open File Explorer (Or, if you have a mac, Finder) and locate this repository. Unzip it, and open square.swf. If it gives you an error, right-click and choose "open with..." and then choose your preferred browser.


*__NOTE: THIS DOES NOT WORK ON SCRATCH 1.4.__*


__How to play__: Space to jump. Arrow keys. Don't touch spikes.
